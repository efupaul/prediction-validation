Space:
I create two lists data:
# pre_process_data 
After finishing reading two input files(actual and predicted), all the matched data will store here order by time.
[time, number of matched stockID, sum of these stock's diff]
e.g.
[[1, 67, 0.0], [2, 74, 0.01], [3, 79, 0.01], [4, 75, 0.01], [5, 77, 0.01], ....]
